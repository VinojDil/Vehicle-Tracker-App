# Vehicle-Tracker-App

This project implements a digital solution for tracking raw material trucks, replacing the company's previous reliance on paper notebooks and printed excel spreadsheets.

### Problem Statement:

The company historically relied on manual recording of truck arrival and departure times, along with the start and finish times for raw material unloading and finished goods loading. This process was inefficient and prone to errors, making it difficult to track the status of vehicles and optimize logistics.

### Solution:

This app provides a user-friendly interface for plant recorders to record arrival, departure, and process times directly through their tablet devices. With just a few clicks, they can log the following information:

* Vehicle arrival time - Timestamp of the truck entering the plant
* Raw material unloading start time - Timestamp of when unloading begins
* Raw material unloading finish time - Timestamp of when unloading is completed
* Finished goods loading start time - Timestamp of when loading begins
* Finished goods loading finish time - Timestamp of when loading is completed

### Benefits:

* Increased efficiency - The app eliminates the need for manual data entry and reduces paperwork, saving time and resources.
* Improved accuracy - Digital recording eliminates errors associated with manual data entry, ensuring data reliability.
* Enhanced visibility - The app provides a real-time overview of all truck activities within the plant, enabling better tracking and decision-making.
* Reduced administrative burden - The app automates data collection and reporting, freeing up employee time for other tasks.

### Key Features:

* Intuitive user interface - Designed for ease of use on tab devices
* Real-time data capture - Updates are reflected instantly in the system
* Tracking and reporting - Provides detailed insights into truck activity
* Customizable dashboards - Visualize data in a way that's most relevant
* Secure data storage - Ensures data integrity and confidentiality

### Impact:

This raw material trucks tracking app has demonstrably improved the efficiency and accuracy of the company's logistics operations. By replacing manual processes with digital solutions, the company has gained valuable insights and optimized its raw material handling processes.
